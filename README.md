# Banker's Algorithm Simulator 🧠🔐

This project simulates the **Banker's Algorithm**, a classic deadlock-avoidance technique in Operating Systems, using **Python**. It includes both **GUI-based** and **animated** simulations to demonstrate how resource allocation is managed safely among processes.

---

## 💡 Features

- ✅ **Tkinter GUI Simulator**:
  - Dynamic input of Allocation, Max, and Available matrices
  - Safe sequence calculation and visualization
  - Dataset management using JSON (Save/Load/Reset)

- 🎞️ **Matplotlib Animation Simulator**:
  - Visualizes the execution of processes in the safe sequence
  - Color-coded process states (Executing, Completed)

- 💾 **Persistent Storage**:
  - Store and load multiple datasets
  - Enables users to test various system states repeatedly

- 🧵 **Multithreading Support**:
  - Simulates concurrent execution using Python's `threading` module
